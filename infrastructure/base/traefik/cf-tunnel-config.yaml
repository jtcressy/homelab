# This ConfigMap is just a way to define the cloudflared config.yaml file in k8s.
# It's useful to define it in k8s, rather than as a stand-alone .yaml file, because
# this lets you use various k8s templating solutions (e.g. Helm charts) to
# parameterize your config, instead of just using string literals.

    # Autoupdates applied in a k8s pod will be lost when the pod is removed or restarted, so

    # recommend using autoupdate.
